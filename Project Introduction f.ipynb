    "#  Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Title \n",
    "Forecasting Fertilizer Efficiency and Agricultural Productivity in East Africa  \n",
    "*\"Optimizing agricultural growth through smart data-driven fertilizer strategies\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Overview\n",
    "Agriculture forms the backbone of East Africa’s economy, employing over 60% of the region’s workforce and contributing significantly to GDP. However, the region continues to struggle with low agricultural productivity despite increased access to agricultural inputs like fertilizers. Governments and development partners have ramped up investment in fertilizer subsidies and distribution programs, yet the return on these efforts remains ambiguous. Are these inputs translating into higher yields and sustainable food production?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Business Problem\n",
    "Fertilizer use is rising across East Africa, but crop yield improvements are inconsistent and vary widely between countries. Policymakers, NGOs, and agritech investors are concerned that fertilizer is being applied inefficiently, without data-driven guidance. Without clear insights into the fertilizer productivity relationship and future needs, policies may misallocate resources, and farmers may suffer from suboptimal yields.There is need to optimize fertilizer use to sustainably boost agricultural output using historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Objectives\n",
    "- To develop a data-driven framework that forecasts fertilizer usage and supports sustainable agricultural productivity across East Africa, empowering stakeholders with insights that guide better policies, investments, and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Objectives\n",
    "1. To analyze historical fertilizer consumption trends across East African countries from 1960 to 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To investigate the relationship between fertilizer usage and agricultural productivity indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To develop time-series models for forecasting future fertilizer demand up to 2035.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To build machine learning models that predict productivity outcomes based on fertilizer use and other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To cluster countries with similar fertilizer efficiency patterns for targeted policy recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To generate insights and actionable strategies that support sustainable agriculture and food security beyond the scope of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Stakeholders\n",
    "- **National Ministries of Agriculture** – for strategic input planning and subsidies  \n",
    "- **Regional Bodies** (EAC, IGAD) – for coordination and policy harmonization  \n",
    "- **Farmers' Cooperatives** – to optimize fertilizer application practices  \n",
    "- **Agritech Companies** – to align product offerings with market needs  \n",
    "- **Donors & NGOs** (FAO, World Bank) – for evaluating the impact of their interventions  \n",
    "- **Investors** – identifying high-potential regions for agricultural investment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Scope\n",
    "- **Countries:** East African states recognized by the United Nations  \n",
    "- **Timeframe:** 1960–2023  \n",
    "- **Data Sources:** World Bank, FAO, and national statistics  \n",
    "- **Indicators:** Fertilizer use (kg/hectare), productivity measures, rural population, arable land  \n",
    "- **Out of Scope:** Non-crop agriculture (e.g., livestock productivity), fertilizer manufacturing economics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Business Value\n",
    "This project delivers a data-driven foundation for improving food security, optimizing fertilizer subsidies, and guiding investment in sustainable agriculture. By understanding fertilizer efficiency across East Africa, stakeholders can make smarter, targeted decisions improving yields, reducing waste, and ultimately boosting economic and human development across the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Success Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy of Forecasting Models**:  \n",
    "   - Achieve a minimum accuracy of X% (e.g., >85%) in time-series forecasting models for fertilizer demand by 2035.\n",
    "   - Low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlation Strength**:  \n",
    "   - Strong positive correlation (R^2 value > Y, e.g., >0.7) between fertilizer usage and agricultural productivity indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cluster Performance**:  \n",
    "   - Clustering models should identify distinct groups of countries with > Z% homogeneity in fertilizer efficiency patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Actionable Insights**:  \n",
    "   - Deliver at least 5 region-specific actionable policy recommendations supported by the analysis.\n",
    "   - Produce a comprehensive report used by at least 3 stakeholders (e.g., Ministries, NGOs, donors).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **User Engagement**:  \n",
    "   - Stakeholder satisfaction score >80% based on post-project surveys.\n",
    "   - Adoption of the framework by at least 2 East African governments, donor agencies, or agritech companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Impact on Sustainable Development**:  \n",
    "   - Quantifiable increase in agricultural productivity or efficiency in pilot regions where recommendations are implemented (e.g., productivity increase by X metric tons/hectare).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Visualization and Accessibility**:  \n",
    "   - Interactive dashboards (Tableau or equivalent) with user-friendly designs evaluated positively by stakeholders.\n",
    "   - 100% of key findings accessible to stakeholders via reports, presentations, or dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
