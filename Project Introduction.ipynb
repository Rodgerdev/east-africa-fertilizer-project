    "## 1. Project Title \n",
    "Forecasting Fertilizer Efficiency and Agricultural Productivity in East Africa  \n",
    "*\"Optimizing agricultural growth through smart data-driven fertilizer strategies\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Overview\n",
    "Agriculture forms the backbone of East Africa’s economy, employing over 60% of the region’s workforce and contributing significantly to GDP. However, the region continues to struggle with low agricultural productivity despite increased access to agricultural inputs like fertilizers. Governments and development partners have ramped up investment in fertilizer subsidies and distribution programs, yet the return on these efforts remains ambiguous. Are these inputs translating into higher yields and sustainable food production?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Business Problem\n",
    "Fertilizer use is rising across East Africa, but crop yield improvements are inconsistent and vary widely between countries. Policymakers, NGOs, and agritech investors are concerned that fertilizer is being applied inefficiently, without data-driven guidance. Without clear insights into the fertilizer productivity relationship and future needs, policies may misallocate resources, and farmers may suffer from suboptimal yields.There is need to optimize fertilizer use to sustainably boost agricultural output using historical data.\n",

    "## 4. Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Stakeholders\n",
    "- **National Ministries of Agriculture** – for strategic input planning and subsidies  \n",
    "- **Regional Bodies** (EAC, IGAD) – for coordination and policy harmonization  \n",
    "- **Farmers' Cooperatives** – to optimize fertilizer application practices  \n",
    "- **Agritech Companies** – to align product offerings with market needs  \n",
    "- **Donors & NGOs** (FAO, World Bank) – for evaluating the impact of their interventions  \n",
    "- **Investors** – identifying high-potential regions for agricultural investment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Scope\n",
    "- **Countries:** East African states recognized by the United Nations  \n",
    "- **Timeframe:** 1960–2023  \n",
    "- **Data Sources:** World Bank, FAO, and national statistics  \n",
    "- **Indicators:** Fertilizer use (kg/hectare), productivity measures, rural population, arable land  \n",
    "- **Out of Scope:** Non-crop agriculture (e.g., livestock productivity), fertilizer manufacturing economics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Business Value\n",
    "This project delivers a data-driven foundation for improving food security, optimizing fertilizer subsidies, and guiding investment in sustainable agriculture. By understanding fertilizer efficiency across East Africa, stakeholders can make smarter, targeted decisions improving yields, reducing waste, and ultimately boosting economic and human development across the region.\n",
